# 🏫 Seismic Safety Initiative for Schools at Risk 🏫

Welcome to our collaborative Database Course project! This initiative aims to combine SQL queries and PostgreSQL databases to address a critical real-world issue: improving the seismic safety of Italian school buildings that might not meet current anti-seismic regulations.

We use datasets related to municipalities, schools, and cadastral codes that have been provided to us. Additionally, we source datasets concerning safety certifications and cadastral values of state educational institutes from the OpenData portal of the Ministry of Education.

We apply SQL queries to these datasets in order to approximate the required investment for seismic renovations. 

As part of the project design, we accommodate the temporary closure of targeted buildings during the upgrade process, transferring classes to compliant structures to minimize disruption to students' education.

Ultimately, our aim is to present the Italian Ministry of Education with an accurate estimate of the investment necessary for these seismic safety improvements. By using the power of SQL, PostgreSQL, and OpenData, we strive to make a tangible impact in ensuring a safer learning environment for our students.
